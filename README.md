# Offloading Multi-Language Research Repository 

Welcome to my research repository about the use of the multi-language technique in a Mobile Cloud Computing environment. At this moment, we have **two** secondary branches available:

1. ***closer2021*:** Related to paper *"An Empirical Study about the Adoption of Multi-language Technique in Computation Offloading in a Mobile Cloud Computing Scenario"* published in The 11th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science (CLOSER 2021). <a href="https://www.scitepress.org/PublicationsDetail.aspx?ID=8F4V9bepymE=&t=1"> link to paper </a>
2. ***divanet2021*:** Related to paper *"Secure Computational Offloading with gRPC: a Performance Evaluation in a Mobile Cloud Computing Environment"* ACM International Symposium on Design and Analysis of Intelligent Vehicular Networks and Applications (DIVANetâ€™21). <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3479243.3487295"> link to paper </a>

If you want to access the code, please clone the target branch and follow the README file's instructions to running the codes and interpret the data generated.
