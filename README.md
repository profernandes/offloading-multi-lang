# Offloading Multi-Language Research Repository 

Welcome to my research repository about the use of the multi-language technique in a Mobile Cloud Computing environment. At this moment, we have **one** secondary branch available:

1. ***closer2021*:** Related to paper *"An Empirical Study about the Adoption of Multi-language Technique in Computation Offloading in a Mobile Cloud Computing Scenario"* published in The 11th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science (CLOSER 2021). <a href="https://www.insticc.org/node/TechnicalProgram/closer/2021/presentationDetails/104378"> link to paper </a>

2. ***divanet2021*:** Related to paper *"Secure Computational Offloading with gRPC: a Performance Evaluation in a Mobile Cloud Computing Environment"* ACM International Symposium on Design and Analysis of Intelligent Vehicular Networks and Applications (DIVANetâ€™21). <a href="http://symposium.nsercdiva.com/2021/index.html"> link to paper </a>

If you want to access the code, please clone the target branch and follow the README file's instructions to running the codes and interpret the data generated.
